        Mueller is defending our democracy.

        When Russia interfered in our 2016 election, our government asked Robert Mueller to investigate. As a former FBI director, war hero, and conservative, Mueller was seen as the man for the job by Republicans and Democrats alike.

        One year later, Mueller’s investigation is gaining momentum and evidence is emerging that Trump’s team colluded with Russia. Mueller has already charged notable Trump campaign officials with crimes, and more connections with Russia appear every week.

      .redline#emphasized
        Mueller’s investigation is under attack from Republican leaders and President Trump.

      .redline#emphasized
        Trump is considering firing the person investigating him in a clear conflict of interest.

        If Trump is innocent, then he has nothing to hide and should let Mueller finish his investigation.

        On the other hand, if Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia, then the American people need to know the truth. Either way, Mueller must be allowed to do his job and find out what happened.

      .redline
        Nobody is above the law -- not even the President. If Trump fires the person investigating him, we need to hit the streets across America and march to send a message.
    .h3.motivation

        If Trump fires Mueller, he crosses a red line.
